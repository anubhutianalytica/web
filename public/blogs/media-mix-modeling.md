## Understanding Promotional Efforts and Attribution

In today’s competitive business landscape, companies deploy a diverse range of promotional efforts to build brand awareness and drive sales. These channels include:

- Digital and social media
- Webinars and seminars
- Face-to-face meetings
- Call campaigns
- And more...

Each promotional activity represents a significant investment, and there is a need to understand how these investments translate into revenue.

### The Challenge of Attribution

Attribution involves analyzing data across different channels and platforms to determine how much revenue is generated as a result of each promotional effort.

#### Example:
**Total Sales = Baseline Sales (BS) + Promotional Sales (PS)**

- **BS** = Sales driven by your existing client base, carryover sales, brand equity, and market events.
- **PS** = Sales driven by your prior and current promotional efforts.

**Calculating PS**:

```text
PS = (Impact of Channel C1 * Promotions in Channel C1 * Cost Per Promotion C1) 
   + (Impact of Channel C2 * Promotions in Channel C2 * Cost Per Promotion C2) 
   + ...
```

Accurate estimation of the impact (i.e., attribution) of channels can help identify:

- The percentage impact of each channel on total sales
- Channel ROIs
- Overall effectiveness of each channel

These calculations often require complex machine learning models based on promotion and sales data. However, they hold immense strategic importance for:

- Identifying top-performing channels
- Eliminating ineffective promotional methods
- Optimizing your marketing budget
